'camelmon' is the Camel Forth source, intended to be assembled under CP/M
(either SIMH or a running Z80 SBC).  This contains the words from the 'forth'
directory compiled directly into Camel Forth.  The .HEX file that is produced
after assembly is suitable to be directly burned into the EPROM.  Use using 'W'
under SIMH or Xmodem under QTERM to send the .HEX file back to the
Linux/Windows box where the EPROM burner is attached.

'forth' is the original Forth text I downloaded using ProComm into Camel Forth
on a running SBC board.  Camel Forth was modified just enough to support the
SIO/2 chip.  I'd edit the 'forth.txt' file on a Windows box and download it
to the Z80 SBC using an ASCII text transfer with pacing.
